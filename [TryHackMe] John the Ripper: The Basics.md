### What are Hashes?

A hash is a way of taking a piece of data of any length and representing it in another fixed-length form. This process masks the original value of the data. The hash value is obtained by running the original data through a hashing algorithm. Many popular hashing algorithms exist, such as MD4, MD5, SHA1 and NTLM. Let’s try and show this with an example:

If we take “polo”, a string of four characters, and run it through an MD5 hashing algorithm, we end up with an output of b53759f3ce692de7aff1b5779d3964da, a standard 32-character MD5 hash.

Likewise, if we take “polomints”, a string of 9 characters, and run it through the same MD5 hashing algorithm, we end up with an output of 584b6e4f4586e136bc280f27f9c64f3b, another standard 32-character MD5 hash.

### What Makes Hashes Secure?

Hashing functions are designed as one-way functions. In other words, it is easy to calculate the hash value of a given input; however, it is a hard problem to find the original input given the hash value. In simple terms, a hard problem quickly becomes computationally infeasible in computer science. This computational problem has its roots in mathematics as P vs NP.

In computer science, P and NP are two classes of problems that help us understand the efficiency of algorithms:

    P (Polynomial Time): Class P covers the problems whose solution can be found in polynomial time. Consider sorting a list in increasing order. The longer the list, the longer it would take to sort; however, the increase in time is not exponential.
    NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial Time): Problems in the class NP are those for which a given solution can be checked quickly, even though finding the solution itself might be hard. In fact, we don’t know if there is a fast algorithm to find the solution in the first place.

While this is a fascinating mathematical concept that proves fundamental to computing and cryptography, it is entirely outside the scope of this room. But abstractly, the algorithm to hash the value will be “P” and can, therefore, be calculated reasonably. However, an “un-hashing” algorithm would be “NP” and intractable to solve, meaning that it cannot be computed in a reasonable time using standard computers.

### Where John Comes in

Even though the algorithm is not feasibly reversible, that doesn’t mean cracking the hashes is impossible. If you have the hashed version of a password, for example, and you know the hashing algorithm, you can use that hashing algorithm to hash a large number of words, called a dictionary. You can then compare these hashes to the one you’re trying to crack to see if they match. If they do, you know what word corresponds to that hash- you’ve cracked it!

This process is called a dictionary attack, and John the Ripper, or John as it’s commonly shortened, is a tool for conducting fast brute force attacks on various hash types.

- This room will focus on the most popular extended version of John the Ripper, Jumbo John.
