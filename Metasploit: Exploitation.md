# Metasploit: Exploitation
![metasploit_pic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/001c8795-43d2-49f7-b91f-e380abe080cc)

# Intro

In this room, we will learn how to use Metasploit for vulnerability scanning and exploitation. We will also cover how the database feature makes it easier to manage penetration testing engagements with a broader scope. Finally, we will look at generating payloads with msfvenom and how to start a Meterpreter session on most target platforms.


More specifically, the topics we will cover are:

    How to scan target systems using Metasploit.
    How to use the Metasploit database feature.
    How to use Metasploit to conduct a vulnerability scan.
    How to use Metasploit to exploit vulnerable services on target systems.
    How msfvenom can be used to create payloads and obtain a Meterpreter session on the target system.



# Scanning
Just run a simple nmap scan of your choice and you will get the desired results for first three questions. For a nmap scan I personally prefer:

    nmap -sC -sV -p- -T4 --min-rate=9326 -vv [MACHINE IP]

Letâ€™s break this command if it just passed up from your head ðŸ˜…

    sC : run particular scripts on the target and check what all can happen there
    sV : check for the versions
    -p- : check all the ports
    -T4 : it is to speed up things(max is T5)
    --min-rate=9326 : nmap will send the packets at the rate of 9326 per second, this 9326 is just a random number that I got from my twitter friend
    -vv this stand for very verbose(refers to details) output

# Metasploit Database
This task has to be done in Linux so either you can use your own machine or click on the drop down arrow on the right side of attack box and select Kali Linux.

You will first need to start the PostgreSQL database, which Metasploit will use with the following command:

systemctl start postgresql

Then you will need to initialize the Metasploit Database using the msfdb init command.

Read the information carefully and keep some notes :

    HTTP: Could potentially host a web application where you can find vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    FTP: Could allow anonymous login and provide access to interesting files.
    SMB: Could be vulnerable to SMB exploits like MS17â€“010
    SSH: Could have default or easy to guess credentials
    RDP: Could be vulnerable to Bluekeep or allow desktop access if weak credentials were used.
