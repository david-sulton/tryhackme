## The objective of this room is to:

    Explain the security functions: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA).
    Present the opposite of the security triad, CIA: Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction/Denial (DAD).
    Introduce the fundamental concepts of security models, such as the Bell-LaPadula model.
    Explain security principles such as Defence-in-Depth, Zero Trust, and Trust but Verify.
    Introduce ISO/IEC 19249.
    Explain the difference between Vulnerability, Threat, and Risk.

# CIA Triad
- Confidentiality ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data.
- Integrity aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs.
- Availability aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed.

DAD triad
- Disclosure is the opposite of confidentiality. In other words, disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality.
- Alteration is the opposite of Integrity. For example, the integrity of a cheque is indispensable.
- Destruction/Denial is the opposite of Availability.
