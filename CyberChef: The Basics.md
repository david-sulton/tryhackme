- CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web-based application designed to help with various “cyber” operation tasks within your web browser. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for data - like having a toolbox of different tools designed to do a specific task. These tasks range from simple encodings like XOR or Base64 to complex operations like AES encryption or RSA decryption. CyberChef operates on recipes, a series of operations executed in order.

# The Recipe Area
This is considered as the heart of the tool. In this area, you can seamlessly select, arrange, and fine-tune operations to suit your needs. This is where you take control, defining each operation's arguments and options precisely and purposefully. The recipe area is a designated space to select and arrange specific operations and then define their respective arguments and options to customize their behaviour further. In the recipe area, you can drag the operations you want to use and specify arguments and options.

Features include the following:

- Save recipe: This feature allows the user to save selected operations.
- Load recipe: Allows the user to load previously saved recipes.
- Clear Recipe: This feature will enable users to clear the chosen recipe during usage.
