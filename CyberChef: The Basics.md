- CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web-based application designed to help with various “cyber” operation tasks within your web browser. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for data - like having a toolbox of different tools designed to do a specific task. These tasks range from simple encodings like XOR or Base64 to complex operations like AES encryption or RSA decryption. CyberChef operates on recipes, a series of operations executed in order.
