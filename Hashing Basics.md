# Intro
- Consider the scenario where you just downloaded a 6 GB file and want to know whether the copy you downloaded is identical to the original file, bit for bit. How would you do that? Or if a good Samaritan handed you this 6 GB file on a USB memory drive, how can you be sure it is identical to the file you want to download?
- The answer to both of the above questions lies in comparing the hash values of the two files; if two hash values are equal, you can say with very high certainty that the two files are identical. But what is a hash value?
- A hash value is a fixed-size string or characters that is computed by a hash function. A hash function takes an input of an arbitrary size and returns an output of fixed length, i.e., a hash value. We will cover various exciting and clever uses of hash functions and values in this room.
- Note about terminology: We favoured the terms hash function and hash value. However, we occasionally use the word hash as a verb to mean calculate the hash value; moreover, we occasionally use the word hash by itself as a noun to refer to the hash value.
